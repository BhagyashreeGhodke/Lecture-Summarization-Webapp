Today we know that machines have become smarter than us and can help us with every aspect of
life, the technologies have reached to an extent where they can do all the tasks of human beings
like household tasks, controlling home devices, making appointments etc. The field which makes
these things happen is Machine Learning. Machine Learning trains the machines with some data
which makes it capable of acting when tested by the similar type of data. The machines have
become capable of understanding human languages using Natural Language Processing.
Summarization is the task of condensing a piece of text to a shorter version, reducing the size of
the initial text while at the same time preserving key informational elements and the meaning of
content.
Text Summarization is one of those applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is
bound to have a huge impact on our lives. With growing digital media and ever growing
publishing – who has the time to go through entire articles / documents / books to decide whether
they are useful or not? Thankfully – this technology is already here.
Automatic Text Summarization is one of the most challenging and interesting problems in the
field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is a process of generating a concise and
meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources such as books, news articles, blog
posts, research papers, emails, and tweets.
The demand for automatic text summarization systems is spiking these days thanks to the
availability of large amounts of textual data.
Automatic Text Summarization gained attention as early as the 1950’s. A research paper,
published by Hans Peter Luhn in the late 1950s, titled “The automatic creation of literature
abstracts”, used features such as word frequency and phrase frequency to extract important
sentences from the text for summarization purposes.
Another important research, done by Harold P Edmundson in the late 1960’s, used methods like
the presence of cue words, words used in the title appearing in the text, and the location of
sentences, to extract significant sentences for text summarization. Since then, many important
and exciting studies have been published to address the challenge of automatic text
summarization.
